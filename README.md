- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/). I learned React some weeks ago and decided to try this amazing framework. I know I still have more things to learn but I'd say I'm relatively comfortable with Nextjs after this project.

While doing this project, I decided to try different approaches and see what's best. The first pages I used the normal approach (desktop-first but making it responsive when I add new elements), on another I decided to do everything first for the desktop and then fix it for the other breakpoints (terrible idea), but at last (for the /technology page) I decided to plan everything first.

It took me some time to decide which elements would be wrapped by divs and how to group the divs together but it made everything easier and faster in the end. I'll be using this approach in future projects.

### Continued development

I could re-do the pages I used less efficient approaches as described earlier.
